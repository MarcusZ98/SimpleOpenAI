# Simple OpenAI Plugin for Unreal Engine 5

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### No responses / empty string
- Make sure your **API key** is set in **Project Settings â†’ Plugins â†’ Simple OpenAI**.
- Verify your key is valid by pressing the **Test Key** button in settings.
- Check that youâ€™re using a supported model (e.g. `gpt-3.5-turbo`, `gpt-4`).
- Check that you have balance added on your account hosting the API key. 

### Output Log shows nothing
- The plugin logs at **VeryVerbose** level.  
- To see the logs, enable them in the Output Log or run with: `-LogCmds="LogSimpleOpenAI VeryVerbose`

### Requests failing / network errors
- Ensure you have an active internet connection.
- Some corporate or school networks may block API traffic, test on a personal connection.

### Large responses are cut off
- OpenAI applies **token limits** per model.  
- Use a model with a higher context window.
